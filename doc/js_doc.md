## Extracting data from tables

To extract table data and interact with it seems to be a very pertinent problem for javascript. Imagine a website with an interesting table. Would it not be nice to perform some basic calculations pertaining to this table, interactively in the console?

### Types of tables

Different sites may be implementing different kinds of tables. Universal solutions may therefore be more difficult. The different types of tables include:

##### `<table>` tag. 

1. This can be followed by different tags:
2. `<thead>`
3. `<tfoot>`
4. `<tbody>`
5. Inside each of these tags, the row is formatted by `<tr>` followed by `<td>` which refers to element defining a cell of data

***Column***: is referred to by the `<td>` tag

***Row***: is referred to by the `<tr>` tag
